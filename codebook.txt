These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'


#  The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'

#  hereinafter , how the code works :
#  after unzipping the combined file, character vector of the path to the 28 text files has been generated
#  all the test data and traing data are included in the following files:
#  [15] "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt", [27] "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt"
#  the two files have been combined in new tibble called "all_data"

#  the discriptive names of variables in the new tibble are contained in the file :
#  [2] "./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt",
#  these names have been assigned as new column names for the tibble

#  the measurments with mean  and standard  values have been selected
#  the activity index for both the test and training data are included in the followin files:
#  [16] "./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt", [28] "./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt"
#  both data have been combined in new tibble

#  all the data have combined with activity and the activity has been labelled like these:
#  1 = "WALKING",2 = "WALKING_UPSTAIRS",3 = "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS",4 = "SITTING",5 = "STANDING",6 = "LAYING")
#  also, the subjects of these experiment has combined to the data

# the final data has been groupped by subject and activity and summarised to the value of mean of measurments
